ADK's require_confirmation mechanics, reconciled 2026-10-27 against the
google-adk 2.8.0 and 2.12.0 wheels (tools/function_tool.py, tools/mcp_tool/
mcp_tool.py, tools/_confirmation_utils.py, flows/llm_flows/tools/_caller.py and
_confirmation.py). Drift fixed: the FunctionTool callable receives the tool
context only when the tool function declares it, not when the callable names
it. Who decides when to confirm, and the durable review record, stay in each
skill. Edit here, then run scripts/sync_shared.py.

**ADK tool confirmation mechanics** (google-adk 2.8.0 and 2.12.0 source, read
2026-10-27; confirm on the installed version):

- `FunctionTool(func, require_confirmation=True)` asks before every call;
  `require_confirmation=` also takes a callable, so the threshold lives in code
  that sees the arguments, not in the prompt. `McpToolset(require_confirmation=...)`
  applies the same to server tools.
- On `FunctionTool` the callable is invoked with the tool function's own
  validated arguments as keyword arguments, plus the context parameter only
  when the tool function declares one, so its parameters must match the
  function's. On `McpTool` it receives the tool arguments plus `tool_context`
  when the callable's own signature names it (or takes `**kwargs`). Sync and
  async callables both work.
- Return a strict `bool`. `None` or another falsy value lets the call run
  unconfirmed (community report #7010), and from 2.10.0 the framework's gate
  holds a call only on exactly `True`.
- Order on 2.12.0 (`flows/llm_flows/tools/_caller.py`): the plugin's
  `before_tool_callback`, each agent `before_tool_callback` in order, the
  confirmation gate, then the tool body. The confirmed resume re-dispatches the
  original call through the same path, so a `before_tool_callback` runs again
  and may refuse it. A bound that must hold whatever the model or the approver
  does lives in the tool body or the store, with the callback as the early
  refusal.
- With no confirmation attached, the call returns `{"error": "This tool call
  requires confirmation, please approve or reject."}`, sets
  `skip_summarization` and records a request through
  `tool_context.request_confirmation(hint=..., payload=...)`, keyed by the
  `function_call_id` (which must be present). A rejected confirmation returns
  `{"error": "This tool call is rejected."}` and the body never runs: report
  it as a cancellation with no attempt, not as an unknown outcome.
- Inside a tool, `tool_context.request_confirmation(hint=, payload=)` pauses
  with a message and the structure the approver must return; the reply
  arrives as `tool_confirmation.payload`. Below 2.10.0 a custom `BaseTool` must
  check `tool_context.tool_confirmation.confirmed` itself; from 2.10.0 the
  framework holds any tool whose `check_require_confirmation` answers `True`,
  and `BaseTool`'s default answers `False`, so a custom tool overrides that
  hook.
- The client answers with a `function_response` named
  `adk_request_confirmation` whose `id` is that request's `function_call_id`
  and whose `response` holds `confirmed` and `payload`; with resumability it
  also carries the original `invocation_id`. On 2.12.0 the framework refuses a
  confirmation whose original call's name or arguments differ from the call in
  history (`flows/llm_flows/tools/_confirmation.py`).
- The answer must come from the authenticated controlling user through the
  application's API, never from A2A, an unauthenticated `/run` or text the
  model wrote. Confirmation records consent; it does not authenticate the
  caller or grant business permission. Forged confirmation responses in
  history were fixed in 2.5.0 and 2.6.0; 2.11.0 adds HMAC stamps with
  `ToolCallIntegrityPlugin`.
- ADK 2.12.0 runs a confirmed tool once per approval (CHANGELOG, bfdeb4a,
  closes #7434); below 2.12.0 a re-sent approval could run the tool again. The
  resume page warns that long-running functions may run more than once when
  resuming. On every version, test a duplicate approval reply and keep an
  operation record or idempotency key: it, not the framework, makes a repeated
  approval converge on one effect.
- 2.12.0 accepts `require_confirmation` on workflow nodes (`@node`,
  `FunctionNode`; 988fd1a), so a gate can sit on the node rather than inside a
  tool; it is absent on 2.8.0. From 2.9.0 a failed node re-runs on resume, so a
  confirmed node whose body writes externally still needs the idempotency key.
- The confirmation page (adk.dev, read 2026-10-22) lists
  `DatabaseSessionService` and `VertexAiSessionService` as unsupported. With a
  persistent session store, a decision that may take hours, another person
  deciding, or completion that must survive restarts, use a durable review
  record instead of the in-session confirmation; approval is permission, not
  completion.
